This project has been developed using Azure Data Factory, and it focuses on achieving specific goals within data management. The primary objectives revolve around efficiently handling database records: inserting new entries, updating existing records without creating duplicates, and ensuring the correct structure of source datasets before incorporating them into the target database. The central aim is to streamline the process of updating and inserting records, thus optimizing time utilization in the context of database management.

To accomplish these objectives, the project employs Azure Data Flow and pipelines. These components are pivotal in executing functions related to data insertion and updating. When new records need to be added, the system performs seamless insertions. Likewise, for existing records, updates are made without introducing redundant entries, maintaining data integrity.

Ensuring the appropriate structure of the source dataset before integrating it into the target database is a crucial step in the process. This validation prevents incompatible or mismatched data from entering the system. The project achieves this by cross-referencing the structure of the source dataset with the correct structure format stored in a separate database. If any disparities are detected between the source dataset's structure and the expected structure, the system triggers an "Operation Failed" message. This prompt acts as a safeguard, alerting users to structural inconsistencies that could potentially compromise data accuracy and integrity.

By efficiently handling record insertion and updates, and by validating the structure of source datasets, the project minimizes time-consuming processes and ensures data reliability throughout the database management lifecycle.
